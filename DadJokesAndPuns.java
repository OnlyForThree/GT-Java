/**

 * Designer: Alex Nguyen + Sayo Odusote
 * Date: 7/7/22
 * Filename: DadJokesAndPuns.java
 * Purpose:  A DadJokesAndPuns application that prompts the user if they want dad jokes or puns: [1 for dad jokes] [2 for puns]
    Note: Use an if statement to check if the users chooses 1 or if the user chooses 2
A random number generator is used to randomly select a number 1-6
If the user's choice was 1, a random dad joke corresponding to the random number will be printed
If the user's choice was 2, a random pun corresponding to the random number will be printed
Note: Use switch statements for when the random generator generates a random number itâ€™ll output a case from the switch statement. You can use a switch statement in the if statement that is used to check if the user chooses 1 or 2.
